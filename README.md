My Boxstarter
=============
Windows Desktop Automation for the lazy, using [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org).

I'm lazy, I hate doing something twice and have the memory like a sieve (Goldfish evidently have a [decent memory](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-19/goldfish-three-second-memory-myth-busted/1046710)). I'm also accustomed to this on my Mac (https://github.com/mefellows/my-boxen).
